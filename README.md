## Project topic 

### üöó Used Car Price & Demand Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling a large dataset of 3 million used cars in the US, originally sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to provide data-driven insights and predictive models to help used car dealerships optimize pricing, manage inventory, and better understand customer preferences.

### üë• Intended User

A US-based used car dealership chain aiming to leverage data analytics to make smarter buying, pricing, and inventory decisions‚Äîsimilar in function to companies like Kamux.


### üîç Objectives

1. Optimize Pricing Strategies: Analyze trends and build models to predict competitive pricing.
2. Understand Vehicle Demand: Identify attributes that influence how quickly a vehicle sells.
3. Enhance Customer Decision-Making: Provide insights into vehicle reliability, value, and market trends.
4. Improve Inventory Management: Predict demand for vehicle types to streamline stock planning.

### üß† Project Scope

**Current Goals**
- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build regression models for price prediction
- Develop classification models for vehicle categorization
- Predict days on market for inventory optimization
- Deploy ML models for dealership use

**Future Goals**
- Integrate external APIs for real-time pricing insights (maybe)
