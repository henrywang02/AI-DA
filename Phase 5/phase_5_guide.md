## Phase 5 guide (Evaluation)

- Evaluate the obtained results
- Analyze and compare the results of individual models
- Review process
- Decide the next phases of the project


Additional questions:

- How did machine and/or deep learning with different methods work?
- How well do different methods work?
- What needs further development in the models?
- How could you further optimize the model?
- Other considerations about the task?

At this stage, the implemented models are evaluated more thoroughly and the stages of model creation are reviewed to verify the correctness of the model.
